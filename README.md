hid_listener
============

A fork of the original hid_listener to parse Multiplo's DuinoBot v.1.2 HID VirtualSerial packets.

The tool is originally multi-platform Win/Lin/Mac. 
The changes I made were tested only on Linux so I would like to know if it even compiles on other targets.

To compile it on Linux you will need libusb-dev package (maybe called something similar on your distro). 
a binary that is included built on Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64. 

Any suggestions or comments are welcome. 

The license is as the original - GPL v3. See gnu.org for details if needed.
